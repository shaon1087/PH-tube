                    <h4>let:</h4><br>

                    <b>Block scope:</b> Variables declared with let have block-level scope, which means they are accessible only within the nearest pair of curly braces ({}) where they are defined. <br>
                    <b>Hoisting:</b> Like var, variables declared with let are hoisted to the top of their containing block, but unlike var, they are not initialized, so referencing them before declaration results in a ReferenceError.
                </li>
                  <li>
                    <h4>var:</h4><br>

                        <b>Function scope:</b> Variables declared with var are function-scoped, meaning they are accessible only within the function in which they are declared. <br>
                        <b>Hoisting:</b> Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their containing function or global scope. This means that you can use a variable before it's declared, but its value will be undefined until it's assigned.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>const:</h4><br>

                    <b>Block scope:</b> const variables also have block-level scope, just like let. <br>
                    <b>Immutability:</b> Variables declared with const are constants, meaning their values cannot be reassigned after declaration. However, it's important to note that for objects and arrays declared with const, the object or array itself is still mutable (i.e., you can change its properties or elements), but you cannot reassign the variable to a new object or array.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>undefined</h4>
                    <b>Default Initial Value:</b> When a variable is declared but not assigned a value <br>
                    <b>Function Return Value:</b> If a function doesn't explicitly return a value, it will return undefined by default. <br>

                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>null</h4>
                     null is often used to explicitly indicate the absence of a value or the intentional removal of a value from a variable or object property. <br>
                    <b>Checking for Missing Objects:</b> It can be used to check if an object property exists or has been set.
